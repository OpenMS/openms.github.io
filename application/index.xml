It performs DDA based candidate identification and constructs a target/decoy assay library, which is used for DIA target extraction and statistical validation (FDR estimation)

Candidate identification includes feature detection, adduct grouping and accurate mass search.</description></item><item><title>PROTEIN-PROTEIN CROSS-LINKING (OPENPEPXL)</title><link>https://openms.org/application/openpepxl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/application/openpepxl/</guid><description>OpenPepXL: an open source peptide cross-link identification tool OpenPepXL is a protein-protein cross-link identification tool implemented in C++ as part of OpenMS. It works with all uncleavable labeled and label-free cross-linkers but not (yet) with cleavable ones.
Requirements The current version of OpenPepXL, version 1.1 is available as part of OpenMS 2.5. Installers for Windows, MacOS and Linux can be found here. OpenPepXL can be used effectively on a desktop computer with 16BG of memory.</description></item><item><title>QUANTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MHC PEPTIDES (MHCQUANT)</title><link>https://openms.org/application/mhcquant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/application/mhcquant/</guid><description>MHCquant: Identify and quantify peptides from mass spectrometry raw data
MHCquant is an analysis pipeline used for quantitative processing of data dependent (DDA) peptidomics data.
It was specifically designed to analyze immunopeptidomics data, which deals with the analysis of affinity-purified, unspecifically cleaved peptides that have recently been discussed intensively in the context of cancer vaccines. (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13404)
The workflow is based on the OpenMS C++ framework for computational mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>QUANTITATIVE DATA INDEPENDENT PROTEOMICS (DIAPROTEOMICS)</title><link>https://openms.org/application/diaproteomics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/application/diaproteomics/</guid><description>DIAproteomics: Automated quantitative analysis of DIA proteomics mass spectrometry measurements DIAproteomics is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for quantitative processing of data independent (DIA) proteomics data.
The workflow is based on the OpenSwathWorkflow for SWATH-MS proteomic data. DIA RAW files (mzML) serve as inputs and library search is performed based on a given input spectral library. If specified internal retention time standards (irts) will be used to align library and DIA measurements into the same retention time space.</description></item><item><title>RNA-PROTEIN CROSS-LINKING (RNPXL)</title><link>https://openms.org/application/rnpxl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/application/rnpxl/</guid><description>RNPxl has been integrated into OpenMS and also the Proteome Discoverer Community Nodes.

Finally a GUI is here. You can find the GUI command in [OpenMS path]/bin folder. Go to [OpenMS path]/bin and run FLASHDeconvWizard! FLASHDeconv 2.0 beta+ works for MS1 and MS2 spectral deconvolution and feature deconvolution. It supports various output formats (e.g., *.tsv, *.mzML, *.msalign, and *.feature). FLASHDeconv 2.0 stable version will be officially integrated in OpenMS 2.7.0 released in near future. FLASHDeconv 2.0 beta+ also supports TopPIC identification better than the previous version, by generating all msalign and feature files for TopPIC inputs.</description></item></channel></rss>
