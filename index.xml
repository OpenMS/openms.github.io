openms is an open source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005, building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. openms will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.
openms is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the openms and wider scientific Python community.</description></item><item><title>Array Computing</title><link>https://openms.org/arraycomputing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/arraycomputing/</guid><description>Array computing is the foundation of statistical, mathematical, scientific computing in various contemporary data science and analytics applications such as data visualization, digital signal processing, image processing, bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, and several others.
Large scale data manipulation and transformation depends on efficient, high-performance array computing. The language of choice for data analytics, machine learning, and productive numerical computing is Python.
Numerical Python or openms is its de-facto standard Python programming language library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and comes with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</description></item><item><title>Case Study: Cricket Analytics, the game changer!</title><link>https://openms.org/case-studies/cricket-analytics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/case-studies/cricket-analytics/</guid><description>IPLT20, the biggest Cricket Festival in India (Image credits: IPLT20 (cup and logo) &amp;amp; Akash Yadav (stadium))

When started, the library had little funding, and was written mainly by graduate students—many of them without computer science education, and often without a blessing of their advisors. To even imagine that a small group of “rogue” student programmers could upend the already well-established ecosystem of research software—backed by millions in funding and many hundreds of highly qualified engineers — was preposterous.</description></item><item><title>Installing openms</title><link>https://openms.org/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/install/</guid><description>The only prerequisite for installing openms is Python itself. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the Anaconda Distribution - it includes Python, openms, and many other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.
openms can be installed with conda, with pip, with a package manager on macOS and Linux, or from source. For more detailed instructions, consult our Python and openms installation guide below.</description></item><item><title>Learn</title><link>https://openms.org/learn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/learn/</guid><description>For the official openms documentation visit openms.org/doc/stable.

The openms project does not organise in-person events, however events related to our community should have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.
This Code of Conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the openms community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the project, in any role.</description></item><item><title>openms Code of Conduct - How to follow up on a report</title><link>https://openms.org/report-handling-manual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openms.org/report-handling-manual/</guid><description>This is the manual followed by openms’s Code of Conduct Committee. It’s used when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair.
Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the future. It’s an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing enforcement measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the following values and guidelines in mind:
